## Part 1: Car Rental Program

### Skill Focus
This part of the assignment builds upon the use of **linked lists** to manage data structures and processes, reinforcing concepts of dynamic data management and list manipulation.

### Objective
In this section, you will write a program that simulates a car rental company. The program will use three linked lists to manage the car fleet, and several types of transactions will be applied to keep the lists updated. You'll also compute charges, handle file operations, and manage error conditions.

### Linked Lists
You will maintain three separate linked lists for the cars:
- **Available for rent** (sorted by mileage, least to greatest)
- **Rented** (sorted by expected return date, earliest first)
- **In repair**

### Transactions
The program will prompt the user to input a transaction code, and based on the code, it will perform the respective action. The transaction codes are:

- `1` - Add a new car to the available list (prompt for plate number and mileage).
- `2` - Add a returned car to the available list (prompt for plate number and mileage).
- `3` - Add a returned car to the repair list (prompt for plate number and mileage).
- `4` - Transfer a car from repair to available list (prompt for plate number).
- `5` - Rent the first available car (prompt for expected return date in yymmdd format).
- `6` - Print all lists (no additional prompt needed).
- `7` - Quit the program.

### Rental Charges
For each car that is returned (transaction 2 or 3), the following charges are applied:
- A **flat rate of $80.00** for up to 200 km.
- **15 cents per km** for each additional km over 200.

### Program Quit
When the user selects the quit option (`7`), the program must **store the data** from all the lists into a file. The next time the program starts, it should read the data from this file and restore the lists.

### Initial Setup
- When the program runs for the first time, it should load data from initial txt files that contain at least 5 cars in each list (available, rented, and in repair).

### Files
Part 1 consists of 6 files, as follows:

1. **q1.c**: Contains the `main()` function, which controls the flow of the program.
2. **q1.h**: Contains the structure definitions and function prototypes.
3. **q1_functions.c**: Contains all the function implementations that are called by the `main()` function.
4. **available.txt**: Contains a list of all cars available for rent.
5. **rented.txt**: Contains a list of all cars that have been rented.
6. **repair.txt**: Contains a list of all cars that are currently under repair.

### Compiling the Program
To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. In the directory where the assignment files are saved, type:
	make 
This will compile all necessary files into an executable.

2. To run the program for Question 1, type:
./a2q1

3. To run the program for Question 2, type:
./a2q2 (with the RPN expression of your choice of course).

## Part 2: Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) 

### Skill Focus 
This part of the assignment focuses on **stack-based evaluation** of mathematical expressions using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). You will gain experience in handling **postfix expressions**, arithmetic operations and managing input from the command line.

### Objective 
You will write a program that evaluates mathematical expressions in postfix (RPN) format. The expressions will be composed of **single-digit operands** and the four basic **binary operators**:
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)

### Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) 
In RPN, operators appear **after** their operands. For example:
- The expression `1 2+` is equivalent to `1+2`.
- The expression `1 2 + 5 3 - *` is equivalent to `(1+2) *(5-3)`.

### Files
Part 2 consists of 3 files, as follows:

1. **q2.c**: Contains the `main()` function, which handles input parsing and initiates the expression evaluation process.
2. **q2.h**: Contains structure definitions and function prototypes for managing the stack and evaluating the postfix expressions.
3. **q2_functions.c**: Contains the function implementations for stack operations and evaluates the postfix expression.

### Operations
- You will need to implement a **stack** data structure to store operands as you evaluate the expression.
- Operands are pushed onto the stack, and when an operator is encountered, the corresponding number of operands are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.


### Program Execution
The program should:
1. Take the postfix expression as a **command-line argument** with no spaces between the characters.
   - Example: `./a2q2 12+53-*`
   - In this example, `q2` is the name of the executable and `12+53-*` is the postfix expression.
2. **Evaluate** the postfix expression using stacks.
3. **Print** the result with exactly **two decimal places**.

### Compiling the Program
To compile and run the program for Part 2, follow these steps:

1. In the directory where the assignment files are saved, type:
	make 
This will compile all necessary files into an executable.

2. To run the program for Question 2, type:
./a2q2 <expression>


## Part 3: Assignment Guidelines

### General Requirements
For this assignment, you will complete two tasks:
1. **Question 1**: Create a car rental program using three linked lists (for available, rented, and repair cars) with operations for insertion, deletion, and transfer.
2. **Question 2**: Implement a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) evaluator using a stack to store operands and intermediate results.

Both questions will be implemented in separate C files, and you will need to submit one `makefile` to compile both programs.

### File Structure
Your submission should contain the following files:
- **q1.c**: Contains the code for Question 1 (car rental program).
- **q2.c**: Contains the code for Question 2 (RPN evaluator).
- **q1.h** and **q2.h**: Header files containing structure definitions and function prototypes for each question.
- **q1_functions.c** and **q2_functions.c**: Contain the implementation of functions used in each question.
- **makefile**: This should compile both programs and generate two executable files (such as `a2q1` and `a2q2`).
- **README.md**: Contains a brief explanation of how to compile and run each program, sample outputs, and other required information.

### How to Build the Makefile:
- Define the overall targets: Start by listing the executables you want to create. In this example, we have two executables: a2q1 and a2q2.
- Set rules for the executables: Each executable depends on object files that are compiled from source files. Here, a2q1 depends on q1.o and q1_functions.o, and a2q2 depends on q2.o and q2_functions.o.
- Define how to compile object files: Next, you need to define the rules for creating the object files (q1.o, q1_functions.o, q2.o, and q2_functions.o). Each object file is compiled from its corresponding C source file, and you need to include any necessary header files for the dependencies.
- Add a clean rule: It's a good practice to include a clean rule to remove all the object files and executables when you're done.

### Compiling the Programs
- Make sure your makefile compiles both programs into separate executable files:
- q1 for the car rental program.
- q2 for the RPN evaluator.

### Documentation and Style
You will be graded on both the functionality and readability of your code. This includes:

- Comments:
Each file should start with a comment block containing your name, student ID, date, and the assignment name.
Every function should have a brief comment describing its purpose.
Add comments for any section of code where the functionality is not immediately apparent.

- Code Style: Follow proper indentation and code style conventions. Poor formatting will result in a deduction.

### README File Guidelines
- Use the README template provided for students.
- You can add additional information if needed, such as specific instructions or challenges faced during implementation.


### Submission and Error Handling
- Be sure to handle error conditions gracefully. For example, Question 1 should check for invalid transaction codes or attempts to return non-existent cars.
- Any compilation errors or warnings will result in a mark deduction based on the severity of the issue.
- Style, documentation, and code organization will also contribute to your overall mark.
