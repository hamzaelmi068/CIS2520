## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  
Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes?
The purpose of this assignment is to gain an understanding of graph theory and algorithm implementation in C. This program will write will read a graph from a file, represent it using different data structures, and perform various graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms. This will help me gain practical experience with graph representations, algorithm design, and efficient memory management.

# Part 1: Assignment

## Skill Focus
- **Graph Theory**: Understanding graph representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List).
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **File Handling**: Reading a graph from a file.
- **Memory Management**: Efficiently using dynamic memory in C (linked lists).
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Using arguments to pass file names.

## Objective
The goal is to write a C program that:
1. Reads a graph's adjacency matrix from a `.txt` file.
2. Provides options to display the graph's adjacency list, perform BFS, DFS, and find the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
3. Ensures robust file handling, input validation, and proper memory management.


## Transactions
### Menu Options:
1. **Display Adjacency List**: Convert the adjacency matrix into an adjacency list and display the list for all vertices.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverse the graph using BFS starting from vertex 1.
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverse the graph using DFS starting from vertex 1.
4. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Compute and display the shortest path from vertex 1 to all other vertices using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
5. **Exit**: Quit the program.

## Program Quit
The program should continue showing the menu after performing an action until the user selects the "Exit" option. Memory should be cleaned up before quitting.

## Resources 
Did you use any resources (for example book, notes etc) in this assignment?
